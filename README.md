# 🍽️ Canteen Waste & Food Usage Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Canteen Waste & Food Usage Analytics** project analyzes food consumption and wastage patterns in a college canteen using a **college-based dataset**.  
The goal is to provide **data-driven insights** to help reduce food wastage, optimize menu planning, and minimize costs.  
All data processing, analysis, and visualizations were done in **Google Colab** using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify **food wastage patterns** over time.
- Analyze **most consumed** and **most wasted** food items.
- Calculate **costs associated with wastage**.
- Suggest **improvements in menu planning** based on data.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: College canteen transactional records.
- **Data Includes**:
  - Date
  - Food item name
  - Quantity prepared
  - Quantity sold
  - Quantity wasted
  - Unit price
  - Total cost

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Google Colab** (Python-based analysis environment)
- **Python Libraries**:
  - **Pandas** → Data cleaning & analysis
  - **Matplotlib** → Visualizations
  - **Seaborn** → Advanced charts
  - **NumPy** → Numerical operations
  - **FPDF** → Summary report generation (PDF)

---

## 📊 Key Insights
